							<p class="justify">Did you know that 7% of US adults cannot walk 1/4 mile? Clinicians increasingly rely on engineers for developing rehabilitation techniques for neurologic disorders affecting movement. This course focuses on the engineering research underlying the development of clinical therapy interventions. You will have hands-on experience with equipment and protocols used for research and patient treatment during multiple visits to the Kennedy Krieger Institute â€“ a world-renowned institution that studies and treats disorders of the nervous system. The course involves a group project component where students will design, carry out, and analyze data from their own experiment that uses a split-belt treadmill. <i><strong class="emphasis">For remote sessions:</strong> You will have hands-on experience with designing research protocols aimed at improving pandemic-time telehealth: you will create your own neurorehabilitation game in Unity based on cutting-edge neuroscience principles.</i></p>

							<p class="justify">This 10-week, 1-credit course dives into neurorehabilitation research, as part of the Hopkins Engineering Applications & Research Tutorials program targeted at freshmen. The course provides an overview of the engineering research into modern neurorehabilitation techniques for patients with motor, cognitive and psychiatric disorders. It will emphasize the role of engineers in the development of devices and in the investigation of therapy treatments that will be used in hospitals and clinics. Students will learn the material through lectures, interaction with patients and hands-on laboratory activities. The course involves a group project component where students will design, carry out, and analyze data from their own experiment that uses a split-belt treadmill. <i><strong class="emphasis">For remote sessions:</strong> In light of the pandemic, the course will include techniques for tele-rehabilitation. Students will design & implement their own tele-rehabilitation game in Unity, and they will test it and analyze data from classmates. Interaction with patients may be cancelled.</i></p>

							<p class="justify">The course explores the biomedical research and tools used for rehabilitation and medical devices. In the first week, we will discuss rehabilitation of movement and psychiatric disorders, and the research into rehabilitation. In the second week, we will talk about devices such as neural prosthesis and smartphone aids for the visually impaired. 
							Students will have first-hand experience with equipment during lab visits, and will interactively learn to design research questions and analyze data. With your group, you will collect and analyze your own kinematic data on a treadmill used for stroke rehabilitation research, and prepare a scientific paper on your findings using neuroscience and neurology principles. You will also design and analyze your own prosthetic device in COMSOL using mechanical and material engineering principles. </p>
