							The physical <strong class="emphasis">sensory information of our body</strong>—such as where it is in space and how it moves—shapes much more than just our awareness of motion or position. It underlies the feeling that our body and actions <strong class="emphasis">truly belong to us</strong>—an experience known as <strong class="emphasis">embodiment</strong>. Embodiment is not only fundamental to our ability to move, learn, and retain new movements, but it is also <strong class="emphasis">integral to our identity</strong>, shaping how we experience ourselves and relate to others. 
						</p>				
						 
						<p class="justify">
							In turn, our <strong class="emphasis">interactions with the world</strong>—from simple motor actions to complex social exchanges—also shape how we perceive our <strong class="emphasis">body</strong> and our <strong class="emphasis">sense of self</strong>. This gives rise to a dynamic, reciprocal <strong class="emphasis">interplay between perception and action</strong>: our internal representation of our body and self both shapes and is shaped by our actions and interactions with the external environment. 
						</p>				
						 
						<p class="justify">
							I am interested in understanding this interplay across <strong class="emphasis">multiple levels</strong>—from lower-order processes of <strong class="emphasis">physical sensation</strong> and <strong class="emphasis">movement</strong>, to higher-order <strong class="emphasis">cognitive-emotional processes</strong> and <strong class="emphasis">social perception</strong>. In my doctoral and postdoctoral work, I studied how simple motor actions—like walking or lifting objects—and motor learning are reciprocally connected to our perception of physical body motion. 
						</p>				
						 
						<p class="justify">
							Looking ahead, I am eager to explore how basic sensorimotor processes interact with complex social dynamics to <strong class="emphasis">shape our experience of identity</strong>—across domains including gender, sexuality, and neurodiversity. I am particularly interested in questions such as:
						</p>	
						
						<ul>
							<li>How do our <strong class="emphasis">social interactions</strong> shape our <strong class="emphasis">perception of self</strong>, <strong class="emphasis">others</strong>, and our <strong class="emphasis">place in the world?</strong></li>
							<li>Beyond how others respond to us, how does our <strong class="emphasis">own social behavior</strong> and <strong class="emphasis">level of authenticity</strong> contribute to <strong class="emphasis">self-acceptance</strong> and <strong class="emphasis">feeling affirmed?</strong></li>
							<li>How do our <strong class="emphasis">emotional experiences</strong> during social interactions influence how we <strong class="emphasis">express our own identity</strong> and <strong class="emphasis">embrace identities different from our own?</strong></li>
						</ul>
						 
						<p class="justify">
							I am incredibly excited to begin this next chapter of my research as I move to <strong class="emphasis">Montreal this August 2025!</strong> If you are interested in collaborating or have opportunities related to this work, <strong class="emphasis">please reach out</strong> to cris.rossi.nb@gmail.com.

						 <p>
							 
							 In my doctoral and postdoctoral research, I focused on simple interactions: walking in different environments and lifting objects. I looked at how children and adults adapt to changes in themselves and their environments by recalibrating their internal representation of their body—how it moves, how it feels, and how it engages with elements in the environment. These recalibrations can shift both perception and action: not only do we learn how to account for these changes and perform movements as intended, but these changes also start to feel normal. This process has direct implications for therapeutic interventions, as it can help in cases where our internal representation is miscalibrated. 
						
						</p>
						<p>
						
							For example, after a stroke, individuals may experience miscalibration between their legs due to hemiparesis—the weakness on one side of the body. My PhD work showed that this miscalibration can manifest in both movement and perception: individuals may limp, and that limp may feel normal. Moreover, this miscalibration can sometimes be improved using a split-belt treadmill where each leg moves at different speeds – this imposed change to the walking can sometimes help recalibrate the individual's internal representation of their legs and reduce limping. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							However, this does not always happen. Why? Sometimes, our brain attributes these changes to external factors alone, rather than internalizing them as connected to our body or self. Consequently, we may not adjust our internal representations, and therapeutic interventions such as the split-belt treadmill may be less effective. My work explores how strengthening the sense that one’s actions are truly one’s own—a core aspect of embodiment—can enhance learning, retention, and the integration of new behaviors into daily life after therapeutic interventions.
