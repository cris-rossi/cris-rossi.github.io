						<p class="justify">							 
							Just days before returning to my hometown of <strong class="emphasis">Bologna, Italy</strong>, I stood in front of the mirror, flooded with memories of what it meant to be a <strong class="emphasis">proper woman</strong>. My parents' voices echoed in my head: <i>Fix your hair. Close your legs. Wear tighter shirts to show your waistline.</i> In that moment, something shifted. I picked up a pair of scissors and <strong class="emphasis">cut my hair short</strong>. I pulled on a loose shirt. Then my eyes slowly gazed back to the mirror—<strong class="emphasis">finally, me!</strong> That was the day I began to understand my <strong class="emphasis">gender identity</strong>.
						</p>				
						 
						<p class="justify">
							Where I come from, <strong class="emphasis">gender</strong> is handed down like a script—one you’re expected to perform exactly as written. But that script <strong class="emphasis">never fit me</strong>. For me, gender is not a box I can fit into. It’s something I live and feel every day. <strong class="emphasis">Being non-binary means peace and congruence</strong>—when the way I look and express myself finally matches who I am inside. It’s no longer about performing that script which took constant effort to play. It’s about <strong class="emphasis">freedom</strong> to let my body finally be <strong class="emphasis">who I’ve always been</strong>.  
						</p>				
						 
						<p class="justify">
							The reflection in the mirror wasn’t someone new—it was the result of a <strong class="emphasis">long journey</strong> of letting go of taught roles and <strong class="emphasis">relearning to live as myself</strong>. It began when I defied my parents—neither of whom finished high school—and chose to <strong class="emphasis">study science</strong>. It continued when I pursued an <strong class="emphasis">international high school exchange</strong> program to explore perspectives beyond my upbringing. It deepened during my <strong class="emphasis">Biomedical Engineering Master’s</strong> at <strong class="emphasis">Imperial College London</strong> and my <strong class="emphasis">Ph.D.</strong> at <strong class="emphasis">Johns Hopkins University</strong>, where I learned to reject my imposter syndrome and accept my identity as a <strong class="emphasis">first-generation scholar</strong> in an academic world. Finally, it culminated in my <strong class="emphasis">postdoctoral Neuroscience fellowship</strong> at Johns Hopkins, where I embraced all dimensions of my <strong class="emphasis">neurodiverse</strong> and <strong class="emphasis">LGBTQ+</strong> identities.  
						</p>				
						 
						<p class="justify">	
							As I prepare to relocate to <strong class="emphasis">Montréal</strong> with my girlfriend this August, I step into this next chapter as a <strong class="emphasis">proud first-generation, ADHDer, non-binary, and lesbian researcher</strong>. Embracing my full identity has reshaped how I think about <strong class="emphasis">embodiment</strong>—not just as the link between physical movement or sensation, but as the <strong class="emphasis">complex interplay between our body, our perception of self, and our identity</strong>. I hope to research the connection between <strong class="emphasis">embodiment, relationships, and wellbeing</strong>, and to empower others to fully understand and affirm their identities.
